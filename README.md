This application consumes data from different cinema API-s. User can see movie events in one place instead of checking all the websites.
Sadly, aplication is limited to showing schedule for only current date, since API-s don't provide more.
Also, user can create a memo, so he/she won't forget which movie he/she wanted to watch.
